# 💖 Yes-No Quest

An interactive, playful, and modern web experience built with a "persistently inquisitive" objective. This project challenges the user with a simple question, evolving through multiple interactive phases using glassmorphism aesthetics and smooth animations.

## ✨ Features

- **SPA Architecture**: Consolidated multi-page flow into a single, seamless interaction.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful, frosted-glass interface with a modern color palette.
- **Dynamic Logic**: 
  - **The Persistence Phase**: The "Yes" button grows with every "No" click.
  - **The Fear Phase**: The "No" button begins to run away using Anime.js.
  - **The Success Phase**: Final "Yepppie" state with smooth entry animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Modern layouts, HSL color variables, and glassmorphism.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and state management.
- **Anime.js**: High-performance animations for button dodging and success transitions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Try to say "No"... if you can!

## 📸 State Flow

1. **Quest**: The initial inquiry.
2. **Growth**: The "Yes" button expands as "No" is clicked.
3. **Escalation**: After 14 attempts, the "No" button starts dodging the cursor.
4. **Success**: The final target state.
